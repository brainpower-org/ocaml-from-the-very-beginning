(* 1. Write a function to determine the number of different keys in a dictionary *)

(* 2. Write a function replace which is like add, but raises Not_found if the key is not already there *)

(* 3. Write a function to build a dictionary from two equal length lists,
  one containing keys and another containing values. Raise the exception
  Invalid_argument if the lists are not of equal length *)

(* 6. Write the function union a b which forms the union of two dictionaries. The union of two dictionaries
   is the dictionary containing all the entries in one or the other or both. In the case that a key is contained
   in both dictionaries, the value in the first should be preferred *)
